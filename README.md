🎰 Spin Machine – Python Beginner Project
📌 Project Overview

Spin Machine is a simple Python project I built as part of my learning journey to understand the fundamentals of the Python programming language. This project simulates the core logic of a slot machine, allowing users to deposit money, place bets, and spin symbols randomly.

The goal of this project is learning and practice, not complexity. While the project is basic, it demonstrates my understanding of beginner to early-intermediate Python concepts and how to apply them in a small, working program.

🧠 What I Learned from This Project

Through this project, I practiced and applied:

Variables and constants

Dictionaries and lists

Functions and function calls

Loops (for and while)

Conditional statements (if / else)

User input and input validation

Basic use of Python’s random module

Writing clean and readable code with comments

⚙️ How the Program Works

The user deposits an initial amount of money.

The user chooses how many lines they want to bet on.

The user sets a bet amount per line (within defined limits).

The program calculates the total bet and checks if the user has enough balance.

A random spin is generated using predefined symbols and symbol counts.

This structure helped me understand how to break a problem into smaller functions and manage program flow logically.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: Python

Concepts: Core Python basics (no external libraries)

🚀 How to Run the Project

🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project is meant to:

Showcase my current skill level as a Python beginner

Demonstrate my ability to write functional and readable Python code

Show my willingness to learn by building hands-on projects

I am actively learning Python and plan to improve this project as my knowledge grows.
